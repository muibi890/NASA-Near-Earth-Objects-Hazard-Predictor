# Near-Earth Object Hazard Prediction Web Application

This project aims to enhance safety measures by predicting the hazard potential of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) using a web application. By providing a user-friendly interface, individuals can assess the risk associated with NEOs based on four input parameters: Absolute magnitude, relative velocity, miss distance, and estimated diameter. The predictive model running in the backend utilizes various machine learning algorithms to classify potential NEOs as hazardous or non-hazardous.

## Features

- **Web Application**: Users can input the parameters of a NEO into the web application and receive a prediction regarding its hazard potential.

- **Predictive Model**: A backend system runs a predictive model using the provided parameters to determine whether a NEO is hazardous or not.

- **Model Interpretation**: The model utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze the input parameters and classify NEOs based on their potential threat to Earth.

- [Jupyter Notebook](Processing_Notebook.ipynb): Included in the project is a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the preprocessing, visualization, and implementation of multiple machine learning approaches.

## Project Structure

- **Web App Code**: Contains the source code for the web application, including frontend and backend components.

- **Modeling Notebook**: Contains the Jupyter notebook used for preprocessing data, visualizing insights, and implementing various machine learning models such as a custom Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest, and Linear Regression.

- **Data**: Includes the dataset used for training and testing the predictive model.
